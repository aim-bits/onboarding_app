## Overview
A basic onboarding UI template app 
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Scroll left and right
- click on "skip" or "next"

### Built with
- Dart/ flutter

### Process
-I used a PageView widget for the horizontal scrolling
I used a flutter package called SmoothPageIndicator for the dots indicator as the pages move.

### What I learned

I became confident with getting packages, for some kind of effects.
I learned about PageView Widget and how it works.
I learned about GestureDetector Widget (for touching skip and next)
I learned about the use itenary operation.

### Continued development

-Designing the texts
-Going to an Introduction screen after the onboarding
